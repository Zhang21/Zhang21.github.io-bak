<p>出自<code>聂努达</code>诗集：《二十首情诗和一首绝望的歌》。</p>
<br/>
<p>I like for you to be still
It is as though you are absent
And you hear me from far away
And my voice does not touch you
It seems as though your eyes had flown away
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
As all things are filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
Filled with my soul
You are like my soul
A butterfly of dream
And you are like the word: Melancholy</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
